> Design thinking is the foundational process for UX teams to identify user problems and solve them.
>  
> Design thinking encourages collaborating and a human-centered design.

***Five stages of the design thinking*

1. Empathize - Discover what the users need.
2. Define - Determine the problem you want to solve.
3. Ideate - Develop possible solutions to users problem.
4. Prototype - Create prototypes.
5. Test - Test your prototypes with users & stakeholders.

*Note: There are no rules to follow these sequentially*

### Empathize

 - Stage of design thinking is essentially a user and market research exercise.
 - The goal is to find complex problems—preferably that no one else is solving.
 - UX designers are trying to solve a human problem.

**Empathize map**
- Says – what does the user verbalize while trying to reach their goal?
- Thinks – how does the user think?
- Does – how does the user interact with a product or move through their environment to reach a goal?
- Feels – what emotions does the user feel—anger, frustration, joy, etc.

### Define
- UX designers **_define_** the user’s problems during the second stage of the design thinking framework
- Analyzing notes and data from the **empathize** stage, a design team looks for common themes or challenges.
- Problem statements align a product to the user’s needs **rather than** the company’s goals.
- During the define stage, UX designers can list features and functionality to solve the user’s problems.
- Tool to help understand their user better:
	- **User personas** – a representation of a group or demographic of users
	- **User stories** – a brief story explaining what the user wants to achieve
	- **User journey maps** – a visualization of the steps users take to achieve a goal (including their environment and how they feel)
	- **Problem statement** – A one-sentence summary of what the user needs to solve their problem

### Ideate
- Stage of design thinking is where things get exciting.
- UX teams (and sometimes members from other departments) develop ideas for solving the user’s problem statement.
- Ask _“how might we”_ questions in an attempt to solve the user’s problems.
- Designers might sketch screen layouts or create paper prototypes to visualize their ideas using pen and paper.
- Brainstorming wild and crazy ideas is encouraged to get the creative juices flowing.

### Prototype
- Stage of the design thinking process is where ideas come to life.
- UX teams often **_prototype, test, repeat_** as they scale designs, add fidelity and functionality.
- UX teams build two types of prototypes:
	- Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes.
	- High-fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes.

### Test
- Stage of the design process and arguably one of the most important.
- Here design teams interact with real users to gather insights and meaningful feedback. 
- There’s a saying in UX design, _“test early, test often.”_
