## What is a good design

1. **Usable**
   >The design, structure and purpose of the product effective for its users.

   - Ask question like:
	   - Is everything in the design easy to find?
	   - Is the functionality of the design easy to understand?
	   - Can users complete specific tasks within the design?

2. **Equitable**
   
   >The product's design is about equipping people with the tools they need to reach their goals and achieve a better quality of life.
   >
   >Equity goes beyond concept of equality (where everyone is provided same resources), as people often need different tools and support depending on their needs.
	
	- Ask questions like:
	- Does it address the needs of a diverse group of users?
	- Does the design of the product address the need of traditionally underrepresented and excluded groups?

3. **Enjoyable**
   >The design delights the user. The design reflects what the user may be thinking or feeling and creates a positive connection with them.
   
   - Ask questions like:
	   - Are there aspects of the design that address the user's feelings?
	   - Does the design inspire pleasure in the user?
	   - Does the design keep the user engaged throughout their experience?

4. **Useful**
   > The product solves user problems. In other words, the design intentionally solves a user problem that the designer has identified.
   
   - It is important to note that *useful* and *usable*, while similar, have different meanings. 
	   - A product that is useful is not always usable. The same is true for the opposite.
   - Ask questions like:
	   - Does the design add value to the users's experience?
	   - Does the design solve a problem for the user?
	   - Does the design help the user achieve a specific goal?
