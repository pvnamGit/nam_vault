> Is a four-step process businesses use to hook users and form new habits among them.

- Four parts of the model:
	- Trigger
	- Action
	- Investment
	- Variable reward

#### Trigger
- Two types: external and internal.
- Habit-forming technologies start by alerting users with external triggers like an email, a link on a web site, or the app icon on a phone.
- By cycling continuously through these hooks, users begin to form associations with internal triggers.
- The internal trigger becomes part of their routine behavior and the habit is formed.

#### Action
- This phase of the Hook draws upon the art and science of usability design to ensure that the user acts the way the designer intends. (Giai đoạn này của Hook dựa trên nghệ thuật và khoa học của thiết kế khả năng sử dụng để đảm bảo rằng người dùng hành động theo cách mà nhà thiết kế dự định.)

#### Variable Reward
- Introducing variability multiplies the effect, creating a frenzied hunting state, activating the parts associated with wanting and desire. (Việc giới thiệu tính biến đổi sẽ nhân lên gấp bội hiệu ứng, tạo ra trạng thái săn lùng điên cuồng, kích hoạt các phần liên quan đến mong muốn và khao khát.)

#### Investment
- The last phase of the Hook is where the user is asked to do bit of work.
- This phase has two goals as far as the behavior engineer is concerned.
	- The first is to increase the odds that the user will make another pass through the Hook when presented with the next trigger.
	- Second, now that the user’s brain is swimming in dopamine from the anticipation of reward in the previous phase, it’s time to pay some bills.

### Key takeaway
Overall, Hook model framework is the method to build habit-forming. The main idea of this framework is to build a method that can manipulate user's psychology. It helps to create dopamine when users try to do something which bring variable rewards.
