## Accessibility
- Accessibility refers to designing and developing software applications in a way that ensures equal access and usability for all individuals, including those with disabilities.
- Accessibility allows users of all abilities to understand, use and enjoy the product
> *The first and foremost step to build an accessible product is to build empathy and install an inclusive design mentality.*
- Accessibility extends to anyone who is experiencing any permanent, temporary or situational disability.

### Four Principles of Accessibility
1.  Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
    
    -   This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)
        
2.  Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable.
    
    -   This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform)
        
3.  Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
    
    -   This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)
        
4.  Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
    
    -   This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)

#### Accessibility level
- Level AA success criteria are organized into four main categories: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.
- The success criteria at Level AAA require that websites and applications be designed and developed with an even greater level of consideration for accessibility than at lower levels.
	- Sign language interpretation: Providing sign language interpretation for pre-recorded audio content in synchronized media.
	-   Audio descriptions: Providing an audio description for all prerecorded video content, in addition to captions and transcripts.
	-   Simplified language: Providing simplified language for content that is difficult to read or understand.
	-   Keyboard navigation: Ensuring that all functionality is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.


#### Making the design be accessiable
1. Follow four principles of accessibility
2. Be good with color
3. Use clear and consistent navigate option
4. Provide visual focus indicate for keyboard users
5. Provide media/image alternative
6. Design accessiable form
7. Visual cues
8. Carry out user testing

### Usability

>Usability is the degree to which a software application or product is easy to use, learn, and navigate, and how well it meets the needs of its intended users.
>
>In other words, usability refers to the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction with which users can complete tasks and achieve their goals when using a product or application.
>
>A usable product is one that is designed with the user in mind, taking into account their goals, expectations, and abilities, and providing an interface that is intuitive and easy to understand.
>
>Usability is an important aspect of user experience (UX) design, as it directly impacts the user's ability to interact with and benefit from the product.

#### Quality components to usability
1.  **Learnability:** Can a first-time user easily understand basic navigation?
2.  **Efficiency:** How quickly can a user perform tasks?
3.  **Memorability** : If users do not use the design for a while, will they be able to re-establish proficiency?
4.  **Errors Tolerance:** What are the errors that users make, how severe are they, and how can users rebound easily?
5.  **Satisfaction:** To what degree is using the interface enjoyable for the user?


#### How to ensure usability?
1. **Research, research, research** your users.
2. **Test, test, test** your designs.
### Accessibility vs Usability

1.  Definition:
    -   Accessibility: Accessibility refers to designing and developing software applications in a way that ensures equal access and usability for all individuals, including those with disabilities. It aims to remove barriers and provide accommodations so that people with disabilities can perceive, navigate, and interact with the application effectively.
    -   Usability: Usability refers to how easily and efficiently users can interact with a software application to accomplish their goals. It focuses on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.
2.  Target Audience:
    -   Accessibility: Accessibility focuses on meeting the needs of individuals with disabilities, including visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments. It aims to provide equal access to information and functionality for all users.
    -   Usability: Usability aims to enhance the experience for all users, including individuals without disabilities. It focuses on improving the overall ease of use, efficiency, and satisfaction of the application.
3.  Key Considerations:
    -   Accessibility: Accessibility considers the technical and design aspects necessary to accommodate different disabilities. It involves considerations such as providing alternative text for images, implementing keyboard accessibility, ensuring screen reader compatibility, and optimizing color contrast.
    -   Usability: Usability considers the overall user experience, including the ease of navigation, clear and concise content, intuitive interactions, and efficient task completion. It involves designing interfaces that are intuitive, logical, and aligned with user expectations.
4.  Compliance Standards:
    -   Accessibility: Accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide guidelines and criteria for creating accessible digital content. These standards specify the requirements for different levels of accessibility compliance (A, AA, AAA).
    -   Usability: Usability principles and best practices are not governed by specific standards but are informed by user-centered design principles, usability testing, and user research methodologies.
5.  Focus on Inclusion:
    -   Accessibility: Accessibility aims to ensure equal access and inclusion for individuals with disabilities, promoting digital equity and eliminating barriers to information and services.
    -   Usability: Usability aims to create an inclusive experience for all users by considering their needs, preferences, and abilities, regardless of disabilities.
