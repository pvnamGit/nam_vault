### Before the test
-   What’s your goal?
-   What results do you expect?
-   Who will conduct the test?
-   Where are you finding participants?
-   What tool are you using (if any)?
-   How will you analyze the results?

**The three overall usability testing types include:
-   Moderated vs. unmoderated
-   Remote vs. in person
-   Explorative vs. comparative
### 1. Moderated vs Unmoderated 
- **A moderated testing session is administered in person or remotely by a trained researcher** who introduces the test to participants, answers their queries, and asks follow-up questions.
- **An unmoderated test is done without direct supervision**; participants might be in a lab, but it's more likely they are in their own homes and/or using their own devices to browse the website that is being tested.

### 2. Remote vs. in-person usability testing

- **Remote usability tests are done over the internet or by phone**
	- Remote testing doesn’t go as deep into a participant’s reasoning, but it allows you to test large numbers of people in different geographical areas using fewer resources.

- **In-person testing**, as the name suggests, requires the test to be **completed in the physical presence of a UX researcher/moderator**.
	- in-person tests provide extra data points, since researchers can observe and analyze body language and facial expressions.
	- in-person testing is usually expensive and time-consuming: you have to find a suitable space, block out a specific date, and recruit (and pay) participants.

### 3. Explorative vs. assessment vs. comparative testing

- **Explorative tests are open-ended**. Participants are asked to brainstorm, give opinions, and express emotional impressions about ideas and concepts. The information is typically collected in the early stages of product development and helps researchers pinpoint gaps in the market, identify potential new features, and workshop new ideas.
- **Assessment research is used to test a user's satisfaction** with a product and how well they are able to use it. It's used to evaluate the product's general functionality.
- **Comparative research methods involve asking users to choose** which of two solutions they prefer, and they are used to compare a website with its primary competitors.

## User testing methods

### 1. Moderated + in-person usability testing

#### # Lab usability testing
This type of usability research takes place **inside a specially built usability testing lab**. Test subjects complete tasks on computers/mobile devices while a trained moderator observes and asks questions
**A major benefit of lab usability testing is the control it provides**: all sessions are run under the same standardized conditions, which makes it especially useful for comparison tests.

#### # Guerrilla testing
In guerrilla testing, test **subjects are chosen at random** from a public place, usually a coffee shop, mall, or airport.
It's **a quick way to collect large amounts of qualitative data** that validate certain design elements or functionality—but it's not a good method for extensive testing or follow-ups, as people are usually reluctant or unable to give up more than 5-10 minutes of their time.

### 2. Moderated + remote

#### # Phone interviews
Phone interviews are **an economical way to test users in a wide geographical area**.

#### # Card sorting
Card sorting is a great method for both new and existing websites to **get feedback about layout and navigational structure**.

### 3. Unmoderated + remote

#### # Session recordings
**Session recordings are** **a fantastic way to spot major problems** with a site's intended functionality, watch how people interact with its page elements such as menus and Calls-to-Action (CTAs), and see places where they stumble, u-turn (go back to a previous page quickly after landing on a new one), or completely leave.

#### # Online testing tools and platforms

### 4. Unmoderated + in-person

#### # Observation
Observation testing allows researchers to **see the body language and facial expressions of participants** without interference from a moderator.

#### # Eye-tracking
Eye-tracking studies can be used to glean information about **how users interact visually with a page**; they also help test layout and design elements and see what may be distracting or taking someone's focus away from the main page elements.
