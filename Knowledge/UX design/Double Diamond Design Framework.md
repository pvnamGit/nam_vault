>The design framework features two diamonds, one representing the problem, the other the solution. Designers must iterate within these diamonds to truly understand the problem and thoroughly test their solutions.

>It is composed of two diamonds that symbolize divergent and convergent thinking.

**The Four Phases of the Double Diamond Design Process**
1. Discover
2. Define
3. Develop
4. Deliver

### Diamond One – Discovering and Defining the Problem
- The first diamond is about UX research and exploration, often referred to as the “problem space”
- Phase 1: Discovering
	- Start by researching the problem and user needs.
	- Method:
		- Reviewing analytics and UX artifacts.
		- Interviewing end-users.
		- Conducting a service safari.
- Phase 2: Defining
	- Define the problem and how it impacts users.
	- Design teams may iterate over phases one and two a few times until they get to the core issue.
	- UX artifacts:
		- User personas
		- Customer journey map
		- A problem statement
		- Empathy map
	- Create a design brief to guide the second half.

### Diamond Two – Developing and Delivering the Solution
- The second diamond is about ideating, prototyping, and testing to find a suitable solution.
- Phase 1: Developing
	- Is an iterable process of ideation, prototyping, and testing several ideas until designers identify a single solution with the most potential to:
		- Solve the problems.
		- Align with user needs.
		- Meet budget and technical constraint.
	- Tools and methods:
		- **Workshops and brainstorming:** gathering as a team to ideate, hypothesize, conduct experiments, and discuss possible solutions.
		- **Low-fidelity design:** sketches, wire-frames, paper prototypes,...
		- **Cross-functional collaboration:** designers meet with engineers, product owners, and other stakeholders to discuss ideas for feedback on possible challenges and constraints.
- Phase 2: Delivering:
	- Once prototyping and testing are complete, designers prepare for the design handoff that engineers will use to develop the final product for release.
	- Conducting UX audit and quality assurance to ensure the final release meets the project’s requirements, business goals, and user needs.
